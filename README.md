For this project, I used Python 3.7.3. Below are all the libraries that I used for this project. You will need a text editor (I use VS Code on Windows). I did test this on my Mac briefly and had no issues. I have also attached a requirements.txt that can be installed easily through pip. If you have pip the steps to recreate my virtual environment are as follows:
1.	Create a new virtual environment within the project folder
2.	Activate the virtual environment
3.	Run the command: pip install -r requirements.txt

If you do not have pip, the list of all the required libraries are attached at the end of this report, as well as in the requirements.txt file.

Once the virtual environment is set up, you need to run the “pt_starter.sql” file in MySQL Workbench. This .sql file will set up the database as well creating a dummy account. The credentials for this account are ‘test’ and ‘test’. Additional accounts can be made by the user. All additional data for the database will be added dynamically by the program and an API.
At this point the program is ready to run!
